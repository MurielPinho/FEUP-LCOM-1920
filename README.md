# LCOM

The course had 4 assignments that were developed during laboratory classes and one final project, the assignments had as their purpose learning to work with I/O devices, both in interrupt and polling mode, and integrating them all of together in the final project. They were developed in *C* using the *LCF* framework provided in the course with *Minix 3* as the OS, allowing us to control and configurate the I/O devices from Minix.
